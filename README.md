# 📬 SMS Spam Classifier 🚫📱

A machine learning project to automatically detect whether a text message (SMS) is **spam** or **ham** (not spam). Built using Python and trained in Google Colab using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Clean and preprocess raw text data
- ✅ Extract features using TF-IDF
- ✅ Train a classifier using Naive Bayes
- ✅ Predict spam/ham for new messages
- ✅ Show prediction confidence score
- ✅ Easy-to-use code in Google Colab

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 📦 Dataset

**SMS Spam Collection Dataset**  
Source: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)  
Format: CSV with `label` (spam or ham) and `text` (SMS message content)

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Load and preview the dataset from CSV
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean messages (lowercase, remove punctuation, stopwords)
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
4. **Model Training**: Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the cleaned data
5. **Evaluation**: Print classification report for model accuracy
6. **Prediction**: Test the model on new SMS messages with confidence score

## 📊 Sample Output

```

Message: "Congratulations! You've won a free cruise. Call now!"
Prediction: SPAM
Confidence: 0.98

```

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Build a Streamlit web app for user interaction
- Use deep learning models like BERT for better accuracy
- Classify by email priority or department (multi-class classification)
